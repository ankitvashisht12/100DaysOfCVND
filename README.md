:heavy_check_mark: Completed till **Lesson 3** of Intro to CV 

## Day 2/100 (September 30, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Completed **Lesson 4** of Intro to CV

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about *RGB and HSV* Color Images

:heavy_check_mark: Completed mini-exercise of **Day & Night Classifier**

## Day 3/100 (October 1, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about Kernels and edge detection technique.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about **High Pass filters** like Sobel_x and Sobel_y for *horizontal and vertical edge Detection* and **Low Pass filter** like Gaussian Blur which *blurs the image*.

:heavy_check_mark: Used `cv2.threshold()` function to convert filtered Image to binary image.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about **Fourier Transformation (FT)** used to detect frequency component of an image by applying *fast fourier transformation*.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about widely used **Canny Edge Detection** algorithm.
