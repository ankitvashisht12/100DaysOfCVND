Track of 100 Days of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree (CVND) and #30DaysOfUdacity Challenge 

## Day 1/100 (September 29, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Took 30 Days Udacity Pledge

![Pledge Image](https://github.com/ankitvashisht12/100DaysOfCVND/blob/master/images/30%20Days%20Udacity%20Pledge.png)

:heavy_check_mark: Completed till **Lesson 3** of Intro to CV 

## Day 2/100 (September 30, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Completed **Lesson 4** of Intro to CV

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about *RGB and HSV* Color Images

:heavy_check_mark: Completed mini-exercise of **Day & Night Classifier**

## Day 3/100 (October 1, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about Kernels and edge detection technique.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about **High Pass filters** like Sobel_x and Sobel_y for *horizontal and vertical edge Detection* and **Low Pass filter** like Gaussian Blur which *blurs the image*.

:heavy_check_mark: Used `cv2.threshold()` function to convert filtered Image to binary image.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about **Fourier Transformation (FT)** used to detect frequency component of an image by applying *fast fourier transformation*.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about widely used **Canny Edge Detection** algorithm.

## Day 4/100 (October 2, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Completed till *Lecture 23* of **Lesson 5** of Intro to CV.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about Hough Line transformation ( Image coordinate space to Hough Space ) and done practical of Hough line detection using `cv2.HoughLinesP()` method of OpenCV library.

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about Haar Cascade algorithm.

## Day 5/100 (October 3, 2019):

:heavy_check_mark: Applied Haar Cascade Face detection using `cv2.CascadeClassifier('./haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')`

:heavy_check_mark: Danger of Biased Model and working to eliminate bias

:heavy_check_mark: Studied about Types of Features : 
                   1. Color feature
                   2. Shape feature
                   
:heavy_check_mark: Completed **Lesson 5** of Intro to CV.
